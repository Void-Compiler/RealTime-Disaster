REAL-TIME DISASTER ALERT SYSTEM

In many regions, people fail to receive real-time, location-specific alerts during natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, cyclones, or forest fires. This delay in awareness and response can cost lives and property. The challenge is to create a web or mobile-based disaster alert system that gathers real-time data and sends automated, AI-powered alerts and safety suggestions to users based on their location.

Participants will develop a web or mobile application that includes the following:

1. Real-time alert dashboard fetching disaster data (mock APIs or datasets).
2. User location detection and personalized alert delivery.
3. AI module that classifies the severity of disaster based on live input (e.g., flood level, wind speed, etc.) and provides safety tips.
4. Optional: Crowdsourced reporting feature where users can upload local incidents or media.
5. Optional: SMS/Push notification alert integration.

What They Will Build:

To empower users with early warnings and actionable insights during natural disasters by:
• Minimizing response time.
• Providing location-specific alerts.
• Suggesting nearby shelters or safety measures.
• Using AI to enhance alert relevance and clarity.

Objective:

The goal is to create a disaster alert system that provides real-time notifications, safety tips, and AI-enhanced alerts.

Challenges:

Short-term: Prototype web/mobile app with limited disaster types (e.g., floods and earthquakes).
Long-term (scalable): National disaster monitoring dashboard, multi-language support, real-time map overlays, government alert integration.

Scope:

• A functional, demo-ready web or mobile app.
• AI-based alert classifier.
• Working notification and location features.
• Optional: Admin dashboard to simulate or monitor events.
